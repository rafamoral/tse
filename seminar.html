<p><u>Analysing forest insect outbreaks via wavelet analysis</u></p>
<p>Oncideres impulviata is a pervasive forest pest of black wattle trees
in Brazil. Available damage records indicate that this beetle can cause
significant harm to tree plantations, with both environmental and
economic losses. Females are known to ring (girdle) the trunks of black
wattle and subsequently lay their eggs. This girdling behaviour can
reduce the productivity of such trees, especially in the early stages of
establishment, disrupting sap flow and therefore severely impairing tree
growth. In this talk I will apply wavelet analysis to time series of
damaged trees in order to deduce when there is an outbreak of O.
impulviata induced tree damage, across three Brazilian municipalities
over 13 years.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>12 April 2023 – Laura Byrne (Trinity College
Dublin)</strong></p>
<p><u>Multivariate Statistical Models for Biodiversity
Experiments</u></p>
<p>Diversity-Interactions (DI) modelling is a regression-based approach
used for assessing the biodiversity and ecosystem function (BEF)
relationship. It assumes that the initial proportional abundance of the
species in an ecosystem is the primary driver behind the changes in its
functioning, expanding on the popular use of richness. The linear
predictor in a DI model includes the identity effect of each species,
along with the interaction effects that may occur between species (which
can take many forms) and can also include any treatment or block
structures in the design. Following the introduction of the DImodels R
package in 2020, we are developing an add-on package DImodelsMulti. The
original package enables the automatic fitting of a range of DI models
for a single ecosystem function studied at a single point in time. The
new package can additionally model multiple responses and account for
repeated measurements on a single experimental unit by incorporating a
variety of correlation structures. Further work in the multivariate
space will also be added to the package in future updates, such as the
prediction of the proportional breakdown of species in biomass over time
using the DI modelling framework. The new DImodelsMulti package provides
considerable flexibility in model selection and estimation of DI models
and will be a useful tool in the study of multifunctional BEF
relationships studied over time.</p>

<p><strong>8 March 2023 – Rachel McCrea (Lancaster
University)</strong></p>
<p><u>Statistical models for conservation translocations</u></p>
<p>Conservation translocations are being increasingly used in the
conservation of threatened species and as part of ecological restoration
programmes (Bickerton et al, 2022). Robust estimates of abundance are
essential for meaningful conservation decision-making and the impact of
translocations on source populations needs to be understood. Within this
talk I will present a new capture-recapture model for translocated
populations and will then present a modelling framework where
capture-recapture is combined with removal/depletion methodology (Zhou
et al, 2019). I will demonstrate that an exact likelihood is possible
when individual level information is available, and I will show how a
standard integrated population modelling approach (Frost, et al, 2022),
which assumes independence between component data sets, can be adapted
to provide an approximate likelihood when individual level data is not
available. This approach, as well as providing a valuable tool for
estimating the abundance of source populations post translocation, also
motivates a new direction of research for overcoming issues of
dependence of data within a standard integrated population modelling
framework.</p>

Centre)</strong></p>
<p><u>Models of Resistance in Structured Populations</u></p>
<p>Neuroblastoma is a paediatric cancer of variable clinical
presentation, from spontaneous regression to metastatic
therapy-resistance. Although the cause of neuroblastoma remains elusive,
it is well recognized that two distinct cellular phenotypes underpin its
development and progression: adrenergic (ADRN) and mesenchymal (MES).
However, how these phenotypes impact the eco-evolutionary dynamics of
neuroblastoma cancer cell populations, particularly under therapy, is
not well understood. This is partly a result of the confusion
surrounding whether the ADRN and MES phenotypes represent different cell
types (species) or cell states (stages in the life cycle of a single
species). This distinction has profound consequences on the way we
understand neuroblastoma and its response to therapy. In this talk, we
will introduce theoretical models sensu the G function framework to
model the eco-evo dynamics in structured neuroblastoma populations and
use these models to tease apart cell type vs. cell state hypotheses. We
will then expand and generalize this framework to continuous-structured
models and discuss implications for cancer and bacterial resistance more
generally.</p>

<p><strong>11 January 2023 – Gabriel Palma (Maynooth
University)</strong></p>
<p><u>Pattern-Based Prediction of Population Outbreaks</u> Insect
outbreaks are biotic disturbances in forests and agroecosystems that
cause economic and ecological damage. This phenomenon depends on a
variety of biological and physical factors. The complexity and practical
importance of the issue have made the problem of predicting outbreaks a
focus of recent research. In this talk I will speak on the Pattern-Based
Prediction (PBP) method for predicting population outbreaks, based on
the Alert Zone Procedure, combined with elements from Machine Learning.
It uses information on previous time series values that precede an
outbreak event as predictors of future outbreaks, which can be useful
when monitoring pest species. I will illustrate the methodology using
simulated datasets and real time series data obtained by monitoring
aphids in wheat crops in Southern Brazil. I hope this methodology to be
useful to non-specialists, such as ecologists aiming to use a
quantitative approach for pest monitoring.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>14 December 2022 – Rebecca Tyson (University of British
Columbia Okanagan)</strong></p>
<p><u>Generous mutualists can outcompete more selfish ones</u></p>
<p>Biodiversity is an important component of healthy ecosystems, and
thus under-standing the mechanisms behind species coexistence is
critical in ecology and conservation biology. We are interested in
understanding mutualisms where there are multiple species sharing a
resource supplied by the same partner. If, as commonly assumed, there is
competition between the species, then, in general, only the superior
competitor should persist. Nevertheless, close coexistence of multiple
species sharing the same mutualistic partner is a widespread phenomenon.
Modelling work has demonstrated that coexistence of mutualists can be
made possible by invoking mechanisms such as niche differences,
colonization-competition trade-offs, spatial structure, or
physio-evolutionary feedbacks. None of these mechanisms, however, can
explain the coexistence of species with a high degree of niche overlap
in the absence of spatial structure. In this talk, I will present a
series of differential equation mathematical models for mutualistic
communities, using the plant-fungal relationship as our motivating
example. The baseline model demonstrates that asymmetric resource
exchange between the plant and its fungal guild can lead to indirect
parasitic interactions between guild members, and coexistence of
multiple mutualistic fungi. With a subsequent extension of this baseline
model, I will present the dynamics of mutualistic communities that also
compete among and between each other and show that coexistence and
competitive exclusion are both possible outcomes, depending on the
competition strength and on strength of the mutualistic interactions.
Finally, we extend the model to the spatial context, and observe how the
introduction of a commercial fungus will affect the resident fungal
communities through the invasion processes that follow inoculation.</p>

<p><strong>9 November 2022 – Patrick De Leenheer (Oregon State
University)</strong></p>
<p><u>The basic reproduction number for linear semigroups in <span
class="math inline">\(R^n\)</span> with an invariant cone</u></p>
<p>We consider linear ODEs <span class="math inline">\(\dot{x} =
Ax\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(R^n\)</span>, and first
characterize the class of operators <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> that have the property that <span
class="math inline">\(e^{tA}(K)\)</span> is contained in the cone <span
class="math inline">\(K\)</span> for all non-negative <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. These turn out to be the so-called
cross-positive operators on <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, or
equivalently, the class of resolvent-positive operators (with respect to
<span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>). We then introduce the notion of
a basic reproduction number <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> and
discuss the trichotomy which says that <span class="math inline">\(R_0 –
1\)</span> and the spectral abscissa <span
class="math inline">\(s(A)\)</span> of <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> always have the same sign (positive,
negative or zero). Basic reproduction numbers are often easier to
calculate than the spectral abscissa, which is why they are so popular
in epidemiology and ecology. We shall illustrate these concepts and
results on a simple model of an infectious disease, and if time permits,
show that controlling <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> one way
may have an opposite effect on the spectral abscissa. This suggests that
one should be (more) careful when lowering <span
class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> in order to control an infectious
disease.</p>

<p><strong>5 October 2022 – André Felipe Berdusco Menezes (Maynooth
University)</strong></p>
<p><u>Detection of Structural Changes in Dynamic Linear Models: A Python
Package</u></p>
<p>Bayesian dynamic models naturally allow for subjective interventions
describing probabilistic expert knowledge. Monitoring forecast errors
based on local Bayes factor is used to find structural changes and take
immediate action. In this talk we will introduce an open source Python
package called <code>pybats-detection</code>, proposed for Bayesian
monitoring and intervention in univariate time series data. The
implementation of these methods through the pybats-detection package,
which in the past was provided by the software BATS, is what we are most
concerned about. This methodology is scalable because, at least in the
Gaussian case, its algorithm has closed form. In order to demonstrate
the usability of the <code>pybats-detection</code> package, we apply it
to a simulated ecological time series dataset composed of species
density or biomass observations and discuss possible avenues for future
work.</p>

<p><strong>11 May 2022 – Shandelle Henson (Andrews
University)</strong></p>
<p><u>Periodic matrix models for the seasonal dynamics of
seabirds</u></p>
<p>Changes in sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Northwest are
associated with changes in reproductive and feeding tactics in colonial
seabirds. For example, warm years in the El Niño–Southern Oscillation
are associated with tactics such as egg cannibalism and egg-laying
synchrony in gulls. How do these changes in behavioral dynamics affect
population dynamics, especially tipping points? In general, for
structured matrix models of populations that are periodically forced by
an annual breeding season, life-stage interactions and behavioral
tactics may occur on a faster time scale than that of population
dynamics. We use bifurcation theoretic techniques to study a class of
such models, focusing on the nature of non-extinction, seasonal cycles
as a function of environmental resource availability. Backward
bifurcations can create tipping points as well as strong Allee effects
which lead to the benefit of possible (initial condition dependent)
survival in adverse environments. In the application, we find that
positive density effects (component Allee effects) due to increased
adult survival from cannibalism and the propensity of females to
synchronize daily egg laying can produce tipping points and a strong
Allee effect due to a backward bifurcation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>6 April 2022 – Ruth King (University of Edinburgh)</strong>
<u>Large data and (even not that very) complex ecological models: When
worlds collide</u></p>
<p>As long-term studies of ecological systems continue to collect data,
the size of such datasets continue to expand in size. This talk focuses
on challenges that arise when fitting (not even very) complex ecological
models to “large” data sets, motivated by a long-term study of a
population of guillemots involving approximately 30,000 individuals. In
particular focus lies on fitting a random effect (or hierarchical)
capture-recapture model. The associated likelihood of the given model
that is expressible only as an analytically intractable integral. Common
techniques for fitting such models include, for example, the use of
direct numerical approximations for the integral, or a Bayesian data
augmentation approach. However, as the size of the data set increases
(i.e. the number of individuals increases), these computational tools
may become computationally infeasible, as for the motivating guillemot
example. I will describe an efficient Bayesian model-fitting approach,
which involves initially sampling from the posterior distribution of a
smaller subsample of the data, before correcting this sample to obtain
estimates of the posterior distribution of the full dataset, using an
importance sampling approach. I will demonstrate how this approach leads
to substantial improvements in computational time for simulated data
before applying to the guillemot example and discuss some additional
practical implementational aspects.</p>

<p><strong>9 March 2022 – Jean-Francois Arnoldi (CNRS)</strong></p>
<p><u>Invasions of ecological communities : hints of impact in the
invader’s growth rate</u></p>
<p>Theory in ecology and evolution often relies on the analysis of
invasion processes, and general approaches exist to understand the early
stages of an invasion. However, predicting the long‐term transformations
of communities following an invasion remains challenging. I will
describe some theoretical work that uses the density dependence of an
invading population’s growth rate to predict if the invasion will cause
large long‐term impacts on the invaded community. This approach
clarifies how the density dependence of the invasion growth rate is as
much a property of the invading population as it is one of the invaded
community. This theory applies to any stable community model, and
directs us towards new questions that may enrich the toolset of invasion
analysis, and suggests that indirect interactions and dynamical
stability are key determinants of invasion outcomes.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>9 February 2022 – Gates Dupont (Princeton
University)</strong></p>
<p><u>Statistical improvements for ecological learning about spatial
processes</u></p>
<p>Ecological inquiry is rooted fundamentally in understanding
population abundance, both to develop theory and improve conservation
outcomes. Despite this importance, estimating abundance is difficult due
to the imperfect detection of individuals in a sample population.
Further, accounting for space can provide more biologically realistic
inference, shifting the focus from abundance to density and encouraging
the exploration of spatial processes. Spatial Capture-Recapture (“SCR”)
has emerged as the most prominent method for estimating density
reliably. SCR presents particularly interesting problems of data quality
because of the requirement for spatial replication of observations of
individuals. I describe two approaches for improving inference in this
regard. First, I develop model-based criteria in an algorithmic
framework to optimize spatial sampling. Second, I integrate finer-scale
movement data to describe detailed spatial processes. These novel
approaches represent essential steps in advancing SCR and offer
intuitive opportunities to advance ecological learning about spatial
processes.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>19 January 2022 – Frederic Barraquand (CNRS and University of
Bordeaux)</strong></p>
<p><u>Inferring species interactions using Granger causality and
convergent cross mapping</u></p>
<p>How to reliably infer interactions between species from time series
of their population densities is a long-standing goal of statistical
ecology. Usually this inference is done using multivariate (linear)
autoregressive models, defining interactions through Granger causality:
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> causes <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> whenever <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> helps predicting future <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> values. However, the entangled nature
of nonlinear ecological systems has suggested an alternative causal
inference method based on attractor reconstruction, convergent cross
mapping, which is increasingly popular in ecology. Here, we compare the
two methods. They uncover interactions with surprisingly similar
performance for predator-prey cycles, 2-species chaotic or stochastic
competition, as well as 10- and 20-species networks. Thus, contrary to
intuition, linear Granger causality remains useful to infer interactions
in highly nonlinear ecological networks. We conclude on inevitable
similarities between Granger-causal methods and convergent cross mapping
due to interaction definitions, and provide suggestions to improve
many-species interaction inference.</p>

<p><strong>8 December 2021 – Chris Guiver (Edinburgh Napier
University)</strong></p>
<p><u>A switching feedback control approach for persistence of managed
resources</u></p>
<p>A brief overview of research by the presenter and their collaborators
on the use of tools from mathematical control theory in theoretical
ecology shall be given. Control theory broadly seeks to both understand,
and subsequently shape, the behaviour of interconnected dynamical
systems by using measurements of the systems, and control actions to
affect changes. Although feedback control is nowadays typically viewed
as an engineering discipline, which traces its roots to the industrial
revolution, as long ago as 1858 Alfred Russel Wallace drew parallels
between feedback control and evolution by natural selection. Indeed,
feedback is an inherent component of numerous biological systems, and
the concepts of model uncertainty, forced nonlinear dynamics,
interconnected systems and feedbacks, and control or management
strategies/actions are ubiquitous in both control theory and aspects of
theoretical ecology related to population conservation or control. As
well as giving an overview of relevant recent work, the presentation
shall focus on the results of the 2021 paper: “A switching feedback
control approach for persistence of managed resources”, where a
so-called adaptive switching feedback control scheme is proposed for
classes of discrete-time, positive difference equations, or systems of
equations, which naturally model managed quantities of interest, such as
populations. The work relies on the combination of ideas from adaptive

<p><u>Estimating abundance in animal communities: A multi-species
N-Mixture model</u></p>
<p>Accurate estimation of animal abundance is of great importance in
areas such as conservation and wildlife management. The univariate
N-Mixture model (Royle, 2004) was developed with the aim of estimating
animal abundance from simple count data, which is inexpensive to
collect, but prone to imperfect detection. In this presentation, I will
examine this existing methodology, and how the univariate N-mixture
model can be extended in order to model populations of multiple species
simultaneously. This permits us to estimate both species’ abundances and
inter-species correlations, which allows us to begin to make inferences
as to the relationships that these species have with one another. I will
then examine further extensions to this model, which allow us to examine
data collected over several years, and data in which a large proportion
of the counts are zero. I’ll finish by looking at simulation studies,
which were run to examine the accuracy of model estimates, and an
application of the model to the North American Breeding Bird Survey
data.</p>

<p><u>The dynamics of disturbed scavenging communities</u></p>
<p>Anthropogenic disturbances, particularly mass poisonings, have caused
crashes in vulture populations in Africa and Asia. Vultures play a
crucial role in scavenging communities as apex scavengers. Scavenging
communities in turn are a key component of terrestrial ecosystems,
ensuring that dead biomass is removed quickly and efficiently. Here,
using an empirically parameterised mathematical model, we analyse the
short and long-term behaviour of such communities. In particular, we
examine the dynamics of a depleted vulture population and how these
dynamics influence the abundances of rival scavengers as well as the
overall biomass removal rate of the ecosystem. Finally, using a
combination of numerical and analytical techniques, we undertake a
sensitivity analysis with a view to understanding how our findings can
be transferred from our study system to other ecosystems.</p>
